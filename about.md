    <h2>Hi, I’m Dan.</h2> 
    <p>I’m a person that loves to learn, which is why web development is fascinating to me. I graduated from Bloc's online immersive boot camp where I was able to expand my knowledge of web development, and build a solid of foundation of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and the AngularJS framework. I'm currently learning PHP to create custom WordPress themes. I enjoy mixing creativity with technology and seeing the results. 
    Besides working with web technologies, I really enjoy a good anime, hanging with friends, and good music.</p>
