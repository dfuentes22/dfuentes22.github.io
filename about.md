    <h2>Hi, I’m Dan.</h2> 
    <p>I’m a person that loves to learn, which is why web devlopment is fascinating to me. I recently graduated from Bloc's online immersive boot camp where I was able to expand my knowledge of web development, and build a solid of foundation of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and the AngulaJS framework. I enjoy mixing creativity with technology and seeing the results. 
    Besides working with web technologies, I really enjoy a good anime, hanging with friends, and good music.</p>

    <p>I like to experiment a lot and this website is my playground, so there may be changes from time to time.</p>
